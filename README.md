# Qt Cpp Elevators simulation

So the other day, I got really frustrated by the elevators in the block that I live in. They work in a completely chaotic way. Sometimes, an elevator passes right by without stopping. Other times, you call for an elevator, and instead of the nearest available one responding, a different one—10 floors away—decides to take the job. It makes no sense...

So I figured, why not build a project to demonstrate a better system?
My plan is to present this to the building management and the elevator maintenance company to show them how things could work much more efficiently.

## How It Works

The project simulates a multi-elevator system, handling real-time requests from different floors.
It uses:
- Qt for UI – A simple graphical interface to visualize elevators in action
- C++ for logic – Efficient algorithms to handle dispatching
